# KMeans

Here I wrote a K-Means algorithm in python which is comparable to sklearn.cluster.KMeans package. In this sections, the kmeans are used for image compression (reducing the overall number of colors to a specific amount.)

## Code

The main code is in [kmeans.py](). I also present a [notebook]() which contains the implementation of the algorithm as well as the output images of kmeans.
